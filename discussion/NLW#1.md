#### Visual Studio Code
Rockseat's development courses are mostly presented in [![VS Code][vscode]][3] text editor and they strongly recomend to obtain practice in some IDE-like usage.

```
wget "https://az764295.vo.msecnd.net/stable/5763d909d5f12fe19f215cbfdd29a91c0fa9208a/code_1.45.1-1589445302_amd64.deb" -O vscode.deb
sudo apt install ./vscode.deb
```

Inside VS Code quick open *`Ctrl+P`*:
- install [Omini theme][4]: `ext install rocketseat.theme-omni`
- install [Matherial Icon theme][5]: `ext install PKief.material-icon-theme`
